# Protein Secondary Structure prediction
PSSP model using features PSSM matrix, HMM profile, Structure length average, Word2Vec Embeddings

- In this project, we investigate the effect of inputting an additional feature to a recurrent
neural network in efforts to improve the overall prediction performance. 

- Experimented with two input features, namely, evolutionary information and amino acid residue embeddings, both in presence and absence of the proposed structure length feature. 

- Our findings suggest that the model becomes heavily dependent on the average structure length, deducing imperfect predictions with the majority belonging to the majority class. 

- Additionally, the word2vec embeddings do not offer much potential to predict the secondary structures which can be attributed to the algorithmâ€™s properties. The Word2Vec model generates context independent embeddings which might be affected due to the small vocabulary of the training dataset of 20 amino acids.
